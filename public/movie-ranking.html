<h1>The best movies according to Michal</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Waiting for the Light to Change</h3>

<p>An impressive debut from co-writer/director Linh Tran.</p>

<h3>Killers of the Flower Moon</h3>

<p>
  Killers of the Flower Moon offers a vivid and compelling study of racism as
  domestic violence.
</p>

<h3>Pain Hustlers</h3>

<p>
  ain Hustlers is both watchable and eye-opening, even though its dramatic
  impulses do kind of cancel each other out.
